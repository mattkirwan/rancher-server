# Personal Rancher Server

This is my initial foray into running my own rancher server. Docker images for rancher-server and nginx are used to run and expose the rancher ui on a custom domain.

## To Use

You'll need a linux box

- a linux box with `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
- an SSL cert.
- a domain name with an A record pointing to the linux box.
- the `docker-compose.yml` and `rancher.conf` files from this repo on that box.
